It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: In his farewell speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five years as President of India, expressing gratitude for the diverse interactions he's had with citizens. He highlights ten key messages from his experiences: \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Youth Aspiration:**  Driving development forward. Kalam emphasizes the aspirations of India's youth, citing a young girl who asked about India's development timeline. This interaction reflects the desire for a prosperous, safe, and proud India among 540 million young people, representing a driving force for progress. He uses the example of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which trains youth in Andhra Pradesh in values and leadership, leading to positive changes in their behavior and outlook.\n",
      "* **Empowering Villages:**  Fostering growth in rural areas. Kalam shares his experience visiting Khuzama village in Nagaland, where he witnessed a functioning village council empowered to make decisions. He stresses the need to connect villages through quality roads to facilitate economic growth.  He also details the Periyar PURA initiative, which provides urban amenities in rural areas through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity. This model empowers rural communities, generates employment, and fosters entrepreneurship.  As an example, he describes how Periyar PURA villages in Thanjavur district have developed internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of JETRO experts.\n",
      "* **Rural Competitiveness:** Utilizing rural strengths for economic success. Building on the PURA example, Kalam emphasizes how rural communities can leverage their resources and skills to achieve economic success.\n",
      "* **Agricultural Growth:** Emphasizing the importance of the agricultural sector. Kalam highlights the need to focus on \"Seed to Food,\" ensuring a strong agricultural backbone for the nation's growth. He shares his interactions with farmers and agricultural scientists, emphasizing the need to double agricultural production while reducing land, water resources, and manpower. He expresses confidence in achieving a 4% annual growth in agricultural GDP through collaboration between farmers, scientists, and industries.  \n",
      "* **Overcoming Challenges:**  Encouraging resilience and success. Kalam illustrates this point with the story of Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a physically challenged musician who found success through his talent and perseverance. He also recounts his visit to Urusa village, where he witnessed the resilience of the people in the face of the 2005 earthquake. He shares details of how the villagers, alongside the Armed Forces and government officials,  collaboratively provided relief and rebuilt their community. He also shares the story of the Car Nicobar islanders who, after the devastating 2004 tsunami, adopted those who lost their families, showcasing remarkable resilience and compassion.\n",
      "* **Collaborative Problem-Solving:**  Promoting partnerships to address issues.  Kalam highlights the collaborative efforts of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and aid to the earthquake-affected people of Urusa village. \n",
      "* **Courage in Adversity:**  Standing firm against calamities.  \n",
      "* **Connectivity for Transformation:** Leveraging technology for societal progress. Kalam mentions his address to the Pan African Parliament, emphasizing the importance of connectivity in driving societal transformation. He proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network, a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries. This initiative aims to connect 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers and 53 tele-education centres in Africa, with pilot projects already underway in Ethiopia. He shares the example of Hyderabad hospitals providing live tele-consultation to doctors in Ethiopia through the Pan African Network.\n",
      "* **National Defense:**  Prioritizing the security of the nation. Kalam recounts his experiences visiting soldiers in Siachen Glacier, sailors in INS Sindhurakshak, and pilots in a Sukhoi-30 fighter, expressing his pride in their dedication and courage. He also highlights his interactions with members of the para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces, acknowledging their contributions to national safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam outlines his vision for a developed India characterized by a reduced rural-urban divide, equitable access to energy and water, a harmonious blend of agriculture, industry, and services, inclusive education for all, a strong healthcare system, responsive and transparent governance, eradication of poverty and illiteracy, a safe environment for women and children, and a prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy nation on a sustainable growth path. He expresses confidence in India's ability to achieve this vision by 2020, driven by the aspirations of its youth.\n",
